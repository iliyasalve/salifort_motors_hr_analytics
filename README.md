# Employee Retention Prediction Model for Salifort Motors

## Description 

This project was developed for Salifort Motors, a French-based alternative energy vehicle manufacturer, with the aim of creating a predictive model capable of determining whether an employee will leave the company. The main goal of the project is to help the company increase employee retention by understanding key factors that contribute to employee turnover.

## Data 

The project utilizes the dataset "HR_capstone_dataset.csv" from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mfaisalqureshi/hr-analytics-and-job-prediction?select=HR_comma_sep.csv). The public dataset and its free use license are available [here](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).

## Goals

1. Develop a predictive model for classifying employee retention;
2. Identify key factors influencing employee turnover;
3. Provide actionable recommendations to improve employee retention.

## PACE Methodology 

The PACE (Plan, Analyze, Construct, Execute) methodology was used to ensure a structured workflow:

* Plan: Defined project objectives and gathered necessary data;
* Analyze: Conducted exploratory data analysis and tested hypotheses;
* Construct: Developed and trained the tree-based machine learning model;
* Execute: Evaluated model performance and provided recommendations based on results.

## Implementation 

All code is written in Python. The code was developed in the Jupyter Notebook development environment.

## Conclusion 

The developed model effectively predicts employee turnover, providing valuable insights into factors influencing employee retention.

The decision tree model achieved an AUC of 93.8%, precision of 87.0%, recall of 90.4%, f1-score of 88.7%, and accuracy of 96.2% on the test set. 

Recommendations include limiting the number of projects employees can handle, promoting employees with at least four years of tenure, and addressing work culture issues. 

These insights will help Salifort Motors improve employee retention and create a more sustainable work environment.
